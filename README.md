## 🌟 What's This All About?

Ever wanted to sweet-talk an AI? Well, you've come to the right place! Our Prompt Engineering Learning Path is like a gym for your AI communication skills. By the end, you'll be flexing those prompt muscles and making ChatGPT blush!

## 🎯 Features

- 🤖 Interactive ChatGPT-style interface (minus the existential crisis)
- 🧩 15 modules covering everything from "Hello, AI" to "Inception-level prompt inception"
- 🏋️‍♀️ Hands-on labs (No, you can't ask the AI to do them for you)
- 🌈 Beginner to Advanced paths (From "What's a prompt?" to "I am become prompt, destroyer of writer's block")
- 🎭 Role-playing exercises (Pretend you're Shakespeare asking GPT-4 for gardening tips)

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Clone this repo (Time travel not included)
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```

   ```
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and start your journey to prompt mastery!

## 🗺️ Learning Path

1. **Beginner**: Learn to crawl (AI-assisted, of course)
2. **Intermediate**: Walk amongst the prompts
3. **Advanced**: Run circles around those pesky AI models
4. **God Mode**: Achieve prompt enlightenment (Disclaimer: May cause spontaneous haiku generation)
